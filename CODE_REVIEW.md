- Images had no alt attribute
- Insufficient contrast between Reading List button and background
- Insufficient contrast between gray text in #empty ng-template and page background
- No aria label on Search button
- No direct connection between label and search input

- I would rearrange the layout of the returned book details
- I would reposition items to get the title in line with the other details, I'd look at it with the image in the upper left with the "Want to read" placed at the top right to see how that looks first.
